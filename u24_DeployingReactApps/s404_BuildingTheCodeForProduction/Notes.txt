### **Building a React App for Production**  

#### **Why Do We Need a Build Step?**  
- The code we write during development **is not ready for deployment**.  
- **Development code is:**
  - Readable but **not optimized**.  
  - Uses features like **JSX**, which browsers **don’t understand**.  
  - **Transformed on the fly** during development (`npm start`).  
- To deploy, we need a **production-ready bundle** that browsers can execute.

### **How to Build a React App for Deployment**  
1. **Stop the Development Server**  
   ```sh
   Ctrl + C  # Stops `npm start`
   ```

2. **Run the Build Command**  
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   - This generates a **highly optimized production build**.  
   - It **transforms JSX** into regular JavaScript.  
   - It **minifies** and **compresses** code to improve performance.  
   - The output is stored in a **`build/` folder**.

### **What Happens in the Build Process?**  
- **Code Bundling**:  
  - All JavaScript files are merged into fewer files for efficiency.  
  - Lazy-loaded components remain **separate chunks** (loaded when needed).  

- **Code Minification & Optimization**:  
  - Removes unnecessary code, comments, and whitespace.  
  - Shortens variable names to reduce file size.  
  - Ensures **faster loading times** for users.  

- **Output Location: `build/` Folder**  
  - This folder contains **everything needed** for deployment.  
  - Inside `static/`, the app’s JavaScript, CSS, and assets are optimized.
