### **Passing Functions as Values in JavaScript**

Passing functions as values is a powerful JavaScript feature that enables dynamic and reusable programming patterns. This technique is central to many frameworks, including React, where functions like event handlers are passed as props.

---

### **1. Functions as First-Class Citizens**

In JavaScript:
- Functions can be treated as values.
- You can assign them to variables or constants.
- You can pass them as arguments to other functions.
- You can return them from functions.

---

### **2. Passing Functions to Built-In Functions**

#### **Using `setTimeout`**
The `setTimeout` function accepts another function as its first argument and a delay in milliseconds as the second argument.

```javascript
// Define a function
function handleTimeout() {
  console.log("Timed out");
}

// Pass the function as an argument
setTimeout(handleTimeout, 2000); // Executes after 2 seconds

// Using an anonymous arrow function
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Anonymous Timed out");
}, 2000);
```

#### **Important Note:**
- **Omitting Parentheses:** When passing a function, avoid using parentheses (`handleTimeout`) unless you intend to call the function immediately.
  - `setTimeout(handleTimeout, 2000)` passes the function.
  - `setTimeout(handleTimeout(), 2000)` executes the function immediately and passes its return value, which is likely incorrect.

---

### **3. Passing Functions to Custom Functions**

#### **Custom Function Example**
You can define your own functions that accept other functions as arguments.

```javascript
// Define a function that accepts another function
function greeter(greetFn) {
  greetFn(); // Execute the passed function
}

// Pass an anonymous arrow function
greeter(() => {
  console.log("Hi there!");
});

// Pass a pre-defined function
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
greeter(sayHello);
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The `greeter` function takes a parameter (`greetFn`), which is expected to be a function.
- It executes the passed function using `greetFn()`.

---

### **4. Inline vs Pre-Defined Functions**

- **Inline Functions:** Defined directly where needed, usually as anonymous arrow functions.
- **Pre-Defined Functions:** Declared elsewhere and passed by name.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Pre-defined function
function greet() {
  console.log("Pre-defined greeting!");
}
greeter(greet);

// Inline function
greeter(() => {
  console.log("Inline greeting!");
});
```

Both achieve the same result, but inline functions are often more concise.

### **5. Key Concepts When Passing Functions**

#### **Anonymous Functions**
Functions without a name:
```javascript
greeter(function () {
  console.log("Anonymous function!");
});
```

#### **Arrow Functions**
Shorter syntax for anonymous functions:
```javascript
greeter(() => console.log("Arrow function!"));
```

#### **Named Functions**
Reusable, named functions passed by reference:
```javascript
function namedGreeting() {
  console.log("Named function!");
}
greeter(namedGreeting);
```

#### **Executing Functions**
- **Pass Function:** `greeter(greetFn)` passes the function.
- **Execute Function:** `greeter(greetFn())` executes and passes the result (not the function itself).

### **6. Practical Use Cases**

#### **Event Handlers**
```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

#### **Array Methods**
Array methods like `map` and `filter` accept functions as arguments.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
```

#### **Higher-Order Functions**
Functions that operate on other functions.
```javascript
function higherOrder(fn) {
  console.log("About to call the function:");
  fn();
}

higherOrder(() => console.log("Function called!"));
```

---

### **7. Summary**

- Functions in JavaScript are "first-class citizens."
- You can pass functions as arguments, return them, and store them in variables.
- Use this feature to create dynamic, reusable, and expressive code patterns.

Understanding this concept is critical as it forms the foundation for advanced JavaScript patterns and frameworks like React.
