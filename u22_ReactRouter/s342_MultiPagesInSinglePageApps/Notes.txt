### **React Routing Overview**  

- **What is Routing?**  
  - Routing allows different URL paths to load different content on a website.  
  - Traditionally, websites load new HTML pages for different URLs (multi-page applications).  
  - In React applications, we need a way to handle different URLs without reloading the page.

- **Why Routing Matters in React?**  
  - Previous projects in the course didnâ€™t support URL changes affecting content.  
  - Without routing, the URL remains static, limiting navigation within the app.  
  - Implementing routing enables URL-based navigation without full page reloads.

- **Traditional vs. Single-Page Applications (SPA)**  
  - **Multi-Page Applications (MPA)**  
    - Each new URL request fetches a new HTML file from the server.  
    - Leads to page reloads, slowing down user experience.  
  - **Single-Page Applications (SPA)**  
    - Only one HTML file is initially loaded.  
    - JavaScript dynamically updates the content based on user interaction.  
    - Improves performance by avoiding full page reloads.

- **Client-Side Routing in React**  
  - React can simulate routing by detecting URL changes and rendering different components.  
  - Instead of fetching new HTML pages, React dynamically updates content based on the active URL.  
  - This approach maintains the benefits of SPAs while enabling URL-based navigation.

- **Goal of This Section**  
  - Learn how to implement routing in React.  
  - Use client-side navigation to display different components based on the URL.  
  - Maintain a seamless user experience without full page reloads.
