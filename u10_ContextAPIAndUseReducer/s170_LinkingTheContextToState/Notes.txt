### Summary: React's Behavior with Context and `useContext`

#### Context Value Updates
- When a component uses the `useContext` hook to access a context value, React **re-executes the component function** if the context value changes.
- This re-execution ensures the component can produce an updated UI based on the latest context value.

#### Comparison to Other Triggers for Re-execution
- React re-executes a component function not only when context values change but also:
  - When internal state in the component updates.
  - When the parent component is re-rendered.

#### Purpose of Re-execution
- The re-execution of the component is **essential** for Reactâ€™s declarative approach, ensuring the user interface stays in sync with the latest data.

#### Key Takeaway
- Components consuming context are inherently reactive to context value changes, making context a powerful tool for state management across an app.
